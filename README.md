# sortMerge
Final Project for Operating Systems class

This program will sort lines in a file, based on the first 8 
characters in that file called the key. The last 56 characters
in that file is called data. That is just something that is 
tagged onto the key that doesnt matter when getting sorted

This program should be run with command line arguments:
argv[2] = number of threads, (1, 2, 4, 8)
There is no check to make sure that the number of threads is valid

argv[3] = name of the file that the user wants to be sorted
